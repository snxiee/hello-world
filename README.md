## FAQ

#### Why did you start doing piracy?

I really don't care about life anymore as I've lost everything and everyone.

#### What is your gender or age?

I'd rather not say.

#### Are you familiar with programming?

Yes, or atleast a bit. I can help people with programming in some languages, as I'm still learning.

#### Do you think people should start doing piracy?

No, I do not think anyone should, but of course my opinion would not matter. I do not condone it, and everything I post is completely for educational purposes.
